/*
PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
CSS in this file will not be used by the theme

Instead edit the custom.less file that is located on your server in the /child-theme/styles-less/ folder. The custom.less file supports normal CSS declarations as well as .less variables (all the .less variables created by us for the theme can be found in the /parent-theme/styles-less/variables.less)

You can copy a style declaration rule from any of your less files and paste it in custom.less and it will override the original style. If you just want to add a quick css change please consider using the Quick CSS field built on the Theme Settings page > Styling tab.
